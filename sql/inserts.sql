The game will also feature exclusive playable content that takes players on adventures between Star Wars: Return of the Jedi and Star Wars: The Force Awakens, providing additional insight about the new movie and its characters.LEGO Star Wars: The Force AwakensMarch Cover Revealedby Jeff CorkMore than 10 years ago, Traveller''s Tales became a household name thanks to its partnership with a toy company and a well-known film franchise. The last Lego Star Wars game came out nearly five years ago, but as fans know, TT Games hasn''t been resting on its laurels. The company has worked with some of the biggest names around, creating co-op, family-focused games based on Marvel and DC comics, Jurassic Park, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and more. Now the company is going back to the universe where it all began, with the announcement of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens.We traveled to TT Fusion''s offices in England to bring you the exclusive details on the game. While there are plenty of familiar things - the whimsical humor, block-bashing gameplay, and mix of Lego and realistic environments - the team has come up with a few exciting twists. Players can forge their own paths with the new multibuild system, which adds an element of player choice to the brick-building sections. Keeping with The Force Awakens'' reliance on blaster action, TT Fusion has introduced new cover-based sections that let you see the ranged battles from a new perspective.The most exciting thing about the game, however, is that Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens features not only gameplay based on the movie, but also side content that gives fans background information on how some of those events came into being. Stay tuned for more information on that tantalizing prospect.To mark the event, we''ve got a pair of covers, celebrating Rey and the good guys and Kylo Ren and his goons.Features: Relive the Blockbuster Action - Blast off into a new and improved LEGO Star Wars experience that takes fans deeper into the new film than any other game, retold through the clever and witty LEGO lens. Exclusive New Story Levels - Experience untold adventures set before Star Wars: The Force Awakens through exclusive new story levels that takes place between Star Wars: Return of the Jedi and the new film. Variety of Characters, Vehicles & Locations - Play as all of the heroic characters from the movie, including Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and BB-8, as well as Kylo Ren, General Hux and Captain Phasma, while exploring iconic Star Wars locales, such as Jakku and Starkiller Base, and utilizing a multitude of vehicles along the way. Build... and Rebuild - Through the enhanced ''Multi-Builds'' system, players must choose from multiple building options - to puzzle solve, or just for fun - all advancing the game in different ways. Exciting New Blaster Battles - Use your surroundings as cover during intense Blaster Battles and drive back the relentless First Order. Experience the Galaxy Like Never Before - Experience the thrill of high-speed, action-packed flight gameplay like never before, including arena-based battles and dogfights in space.

At its core, Infinite Warfare returns to the roots of the franchise where cinematic, immersive storytelling takes center stage as told through an unfolding large-scale war and epic battles that deliver an authentic Call of Duty experience. Game Overview Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare delivers something for every Call of Duty fan with three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. Delivering a rich and engaging narrative in a setting unlike anything to date in a Call of Duty game, the campaign is a return to the franchise’s gritty, military roots throughout new environments never before seen in the franchise. The player will embark on a classic war story about grand scale warfare; all set in a grounded future where human conflict has spread throughout our solar system. Multiplayer action combines Call of Duty’s popular chain-based movement system with ground-breaking gameplay innovations to deliver the deepest and most engaging Call of Duty experience to date. The title introduces stunning, never before seen, multi-planetary environments, new weaponry, and all-new player abilities to Call of Duty.  In addition, the new Zombies experience will thrill co-op players with an original direction featuring fun and unique gameplay, all wrapped into an entertaining narrative sure to excite fans. Game Details RETURN TO CLASSIC, LARGE-SCALE WAR Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare will take players on an unforgettable journey as they engage in battles from Earth to beyond our atmosphere against a relentless, enemy faction that threatens our very way of life.  It’s grand scale war and hallmark boots-on-the-ground Call of Duty action with memorable characters, rich emotional arcs, and stunning new environments, all within an epic new setting. A CALL OF DUTY CAMPAIGN TO REMEMBER Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare puts storytelling front and center, in a deeply engaging narrative. It features jaw-dropping set-pieces and blockbuster cinematic moments, while also delivering a gripping portrayal of war that harkens back to the roots of the franchise. Infinity Ward also breaks new ground by thrusting the player into wartime leadership as Captain Reyes, a Tier 1 Special Operations pilot, who takes the helm of the Retribution, one of Earth’s last remaining warships. In a time of unthinkable hardships, Reyes must lead the remnants of coalition forces against a relentless foe in a war that spans our solar system. FIGHTING A FANATICAL ENEMY The Settlement Defense Front (SetDef) represents a splinter group of insurgents that broke away from the United Nations Space Alliance during a war of secession, years ago. In the world of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, our planet has been stripped of its natural assets through population growth and industrial expansion. The people of Earth now rely upon colonies throughout the solar system to mine planets and asteroids for necessary fuel and other resources. The SetDef is a fascist power, comprised of brutal and militant radicals, toughened by the extreme conditions of offworld environments. They seek to control those outposts and their wealth, putting a stranglehold on the countries of Earth. After years of uneasy stalemate, diplomatic relations are strained, and it will take only the slightest nudge to lead to full-scale war.  GEAR UP FOR INTENSE MULTIPLAYER Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare will incorporate the popular chain-based movement system players know and love into an innovative multiplayer experience that rewards players more than ever before for utilizing their surroundings and applying strategy in the heat of the moment. Maps are designed to further leverage the chain-based movement system and immerse players into fast, fun, and frenetic gameplay that players have come to expect from Call of Duty. With its new approach to play, multiplayer will bring innovative gameplay that challenges players to achieve their goals in creative ways based on their specific play style. BATTLE THE LIVING DEAD IN A ZOMBIES THRILLER Infinity Ward introduces a fresh take on the nightmarish Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. With an all-new, immersive Zombies storyline for players to uncover and explore, players are thrust into a spine tingling adventure not for the faint of heart. Zombies will take players on a wild ride with a multitude of new features, while thrilling players with the core mechanics that fans have come to expect from the mode. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare raises the bar yet again, delivering three stellar experiences in one exceptional package.

Yeti uses Blue’s proprietary tri-capsule technology to produce pristine, studio-quality recordings with ease. With an all-new total blackout finish, Blackout Yeti adds style and energy to your recording or broadcasting setup. Blackout Yeti features four different pattern settings so you can record vocals, instruments, podcasts, gameplay, or stream in ways that would normally require multiple microphones. With simple controls for headphone volume, pattern selection, instant mute, microphone gain, and plug ‘n play install, Blackout Yeti is the most versatile USB mic on the market today. Whether you’re recording/broadcasting at home, on the road, or in the Himalayas, Blackout Yeti helps you get studio-quality sound every time. Tri-capsule array—three condenser capsules can record almost any situation Multiple pattern selection—cardioid, bidirectional, omnidirectional and stereo Gain control, mute button and zero-latency headphone output Perfect for vocals, instruments, podcasting, recording gameplay, streaming, voiceovers, interviews, field recordings, conference calls and more Plug ''n play—Mac and PC compatible Four Different Pattern Modes for Versatile RecordingUsing Blue Microphone''s proprietary tri-capsule technology, Blackout Yeti can record sounds that range from the barely audible to the deafeningly loud—all without a loss of fidelity. Depending on what kind of sound you’re recording, you can choose from four distinct pattern modes: Stereo mode: The stereo mode uses both the left and right channels, and is ideal for capturing a realistic, general sound image. Cardioid mode: Well-suited for podcasts, vocals, or game streaming, cardioid mode records sound sources that are directly in front of the microphone. It delivers a rich, full-bodied sound. Omnidirectional mode: Omnidirectional mode picks up sound equally from all directions. It’s best used in situations when you want to capture the ambience of ''being there''—like a live recording of a band''s performance. Bidirectional mode: Bidirectional mode records from both the front and the rear of the microphone. It’s ideal for capturing the nuance of a musical instrument, or recording an interview between two people. Control Your Recording in Real-TimeWith controls for headphone volume, pattern selection, instant mute, and microphone gain located directly on the mic, Blackout Yeti puts you in charge of every level of the recording process. If you’re experiencing distortion or feedback while recording an especially loud source, simply adjust the microphone''s sensitivity with the gain control. Or, if you want to take a break in the middle of a podcast, use the instant mute button. The microphone comes equipped with a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack and allows you to listen to what you''re recording in real-time, without latency delays. You can adjust the volume of your headphones using a control on the front of the microphone.Innovative Design Makes Recording EasyWith its integrated, custom desktop stand, you can adjust and pivot Blackout Yeti in relation to the sound source, improving sound quality. Once you have it at a desired angle, you can use the setscrews to secure it in place.

The biggest step in gameplay innovation in franchise history, FIFA 18 introduces Real Player Motion Technology, an all-new animation system which unlocks a new level of responsiveness, and player personality – now Cristiano Ronaldo and other top players feel and move exactly like they do on the real pitch. Player Control combined with new Team Styles and Positioning give you the tools to deliver Dramatic Moments that ignite Immersive Atmospheres around the world. The World’s Game also takes you on a global journey as Alex Hunter Returns along with a star-studded cast of characters, including Cristiano Ronaldo and other European football stars. And in FIFA Ultimate Team™, FUT ICONS, featuring Ronaldo Nazário and other football legends, are coming to FIFA 18 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC when the game launches on September 29, 2017. GAMEPLAY AND PRESENTATION Powered by Frostbite Attention to innovation in true-to-life action, new football worlds and character depth, Frostbite helps to further blur the lines between the virtual and real worlds. Using movie studio-style advanced shadowing and occlusion techniques to benefit character rendering and overall pitch presentation, FIFA 18 delivers the most visually arresting and authentic football simulation ever. Player Control Real Player Motion Technology: The all-new, game-changing animation system utilizes pose trajectory matching on every frame to deliver the franchise’s most responsive and fluid gameplay ever. New motion capture techniques and frame by frame animation transitions ensure gameplay accurately represents the reality of football. Real Player Motion Tech is the catalyst for an increased fidelity in movement for every player on the pitch, immediately taking authenticity to another level.    Player Personality: Six new character archetypes and new player mapping technology differentiate players on the pitch to give them their own distinct identity. For the first time ever, real-world movements, size and attributes inform how a player moves, allowing you to feel the life-like tendencies of the world’s best. Ronaldo’s signature sprint, Sterling’s unique turns, and Robben’s distinct arm movement are all immediately recognizable in FIFA 18. Dribbling Overhaul: In FIFA 18, you will run at defenders with confidence knowing that the best players can change direction on a dime. New dribbling mechanics enable players to inject more creativity into 1v1 situations. Take more defined touches, make tighter turns, and explode into attack more dynamically than ever before. Responsive: Creative on-ball skills, contextual touches, and a re-imagining of the control dribble mechanic give players new options when building up attacks in tight spaces. Change direction with ease and feel your player respond when you escape a defender lunging to tackle. Explosive: Authentic and dynamic speed-based animations allow you to explode more rapidly from controlled touches into full tilt sprints. Team Styles and Positioning New Player Positioning: With more freedom in motion, your teammates examine the pitch and react accordingly; darting forward in coordinated runs, or moving into space to provide consistent attacking support. New player positioning gives you a well-balanced and spread pitch with more opportunities in time and space to read the play. Team Styles: A deep set of authentic playing styles attributed to several teams put the most-recognized tactics on the pitch in FIFA 18 - now in AI you will immediately recognize the tiki-taka of some of Europe’s best clubs or the high-pressing style of teams in the Premier League. Feel a change in defensive and attacking approaches every time you choose a new club or opponent. Dynamic Quick Substitutes: All-new context based substitution prompts allow players to easily make changes without pausing the match. Whether it''s a missed chance, or necessary response to conceding a goal, you can instantly decide if a change is needed without visiting the menu. Immersive Atmospheres Regional Atmospheres: Authentic sun positions, cinematic atmosphere grading, signature pitch-side fixtures, authentic broadcast overlays in La Liga and MLS, on-pitch debris, club and stadium specific banners, adaptive commentary, and changes in pitch quality all come together to bring the most immersive football experiences to life in FIFA 18. High-Def Dynamic Crowds: All-new individual crowd reactions and expanded regional chant support have you feeding off the energy of your supporters. Hear authentic chants build as you mount an attack, incite realistic excitement when you score and even interact with the crowd while celebrating. Dramatic Moments Wonder Goals: New locomotion and finishing animations unlock more fluid striking and heading, combining to increase the potential for more dramatic finishes. Player Personality ensures the heroes of the game stand tall in the biggest moments, finishing more often on the biggest stages.  New Crossing Control: All-new crossing controls provide the player with a variety of options to put the ball into the box, creating dynamic attacking chances. Whipped to the spot, arching, and back-stick crosses increase the variety of delivery to accurately pick out the attacking player. THE JOURNEY: HUNTER RETURNS The World’s Game takes you on a global journey as Alex Hunter returns along with a star-studded cast of characters and top football talent, like Ronaldo and other European stars.

padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 60px} Story Taking place before the rise of Gotham City''s most dangerous criminals, villains and assassins, players will meet many important characters for the first time.The game showcases a young, raw, unrefined Batman as he faces a defining moment in his early career as a crime fighter that sets his path to becoming the Dark Knight. As the story unfolds, witness identities being formed and key relationships being forged. From the Files of the Gotham City Police Department Anonymous Vigilante BATMAN Conflicting reports of the suspect range from a highly trained individual or group of individuals, to allegations of a ?large winged creature.? Sporadic sightings were first reported two years ago, though frequency of sightings is up 80% in last six months. Limited photographic and forensic evidence suggests a single individual ? a white male adult - utilizing a dark, militarized armor with unexplained high mobility.Various statements indicate the suspect is armed with hi-tech weaponry and tools, which may allow for rapid deployment and navigation between buildings. Unsubstantiated claims indicate the suspect employs unlicensed low-flying aircraft.Multiple outstanding warrants for ?The Batman? exist, including: assault with a deadly weapon against both criminals and law enforcement officers, breaking and entering, carrying a concealed weapon, interfering with a crime scene, and fleeing the scene of a crime. Considered armed and extremely dangerous. Multiple cases of resisting arrest have proven suspect both an expert hand-to-hand combatant and evasion specialist. Roman Sionis BLACK MASK Gotham City business owner Roman Sionis is alleged to be one of the city?s most powerful crime lords, though no convictions have ever been made. Sionis maintains several ?legitimate? businesses - many of which are believed to be fronts for illegal operations. Notable businesses in his portfolio include: Janus Cosmetics, Gotham Merchants? Bank, and the now-defunct Sionis Steel Works. Sionis has been charged with embezzling city funds, murder, racketeering, distribution of illegal narcotics, and other offenses, but never convicted. In previous trials, witnesses for the prosecution have been known to recant, die, or disappear. Investigation is ongoing. Slade Wilson DEATHSTROKE FBI files link Slade Wilson to the assassination of various offshore dictators and business people. Less is known about his domestic activities. Additional skills include: Weapons expert. Demolitions expert. Close quarters combat. Ambush techniques.Following his military service, Wilson worked for various private military contractors before striking out on his own ? and allegedly becoming one of the highest paid contract killers in the world, specializing in high profile assassinations.CONFIRMED METAHUMAN STATUS ? experimental speed and strength enhancements of unknown origin. Suspect should be assumed to be armed with multiple weapons, and considered expert with edged weapons, firearms and explosives. Distinguishing characteristics include an impaired right eye, graying hair, and orange accented black body armor. Name Unknown BANE The fugitive known as ?Bane? is currently on the run and wanted by the sovereign government of Santa Prisca following a prison break from Pena Duro penitentiary. While no records have been found to substantiate this, rumors allege Bane was born and raised within the prison walls. Bane is believed to be travelling with a large group of mercenaries who refer to themselves only as ?Followers?.Bane is rumored to have larger-than-normal size and extraordinary strength ? though this is believed to be as a result of his abuse of performance enhancing drugs. Witnesses report observing temporary changes in musculature and bone structure in certain circumstances, but without physical proof this is regarded as unreliable testimony.Individual is deemed extremely dangerous ? and as cunning as he is physically strong. While he is often armed, his extreme physical strength is considered a deadly weapon even when he is unarmed. Floyd Lawton DEADSHOT Prior to his dishonorable discharge, Lawton received ?Expert? level Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges in all AR670-1 weapon categories. Academy instructors remarked that he didn?t find directly hitting targets a challenge and has a tendency to insert his own additional requirements in order to ?make things interesting?.Little is known about Lawton since his discharge, though he is a suspect in connection with several murders and assassinations, all of which involved uniquely complex ballistic scenarios at long range.Federal and Interpol warrants have been issued but never served, and Federal warrants alternate between valid and rescinded. Lawton should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. Known for high-risk tactics to decrease his survivability and increase difficulty of any task at hand. It is highly likely that Lawton harbors a death wish ? consider this when engaging the suspect. COPPERHEAD COPPERHEAD ''''Copperhead'''' is a possible group identity or floating moniker.Initial reports of a contract killer using the name ''''Copperhead'''' have appeared in various South American Criminal Databases. Reports were, however, inconsistent: conflicting intelligence suggests ''''Copperhead'''' may be a pair or even a group of individuals, both male and female, operating under the pseudonym. Analysts suggest Guatemala is the center of operations of this identity.Consistent elements include snake-themed tattoo markings, and non-restrictive garment to aid with agility. At least two known suspects have been known to avoid wearing footwear.Some elements are consistent across all reports, and will be represented here. All reports indicate the killer is highly mobile, with an extremely flexible physiology. Case detectives suggest that the individual uses this ability to gain access to structures via small accessways, vents, and construction imperfections. Attributed killings are consistently either asphyxiation, fracture of the cervical vertebrae, or death through the application of exotic poisons. Name Unknown ANARKY Earlier reports flagged suspect as graffiti artist with an anti-authority/anarchist leanings. Suspected of organizing radical protests, occupying public spaces and erecting tent cities, and other public disturbances. Uses social media and hacktivism to harass political figures, business leaders, and peace officers. Targets individuals and organizations of financial success or prominence. Reports of recent radicalization from undercover officers. Acquisition of well-known precursors suggest attempts at manufacturing explosive devices. Anarky is wanted on charges of trespassing, destruction of public property, destruction of government property, and unregistered demonstrations. Has been added to domestic terrorist watch Name Unknown FIREFLY Unstable, erratic individual with advanced weaponry and demolition skills. Lynns is equipped with a military-grade flamethrower and custom light assembly acquired from an unascertained source. Has been alleged to steal chemical materials in bulk ? aviation fuels, various chemical primers, and restricted reagents that suggest a specific chemical requirement for both the flight fuels and his incinerator device.His source files denote extensive psychological issues. Top level summary is that Lynns displays a total disregard for his well being at a level that would be classified as irrational. Extreme disregard for his own safety ? this has caused or is symptomatic of the degree of burns he has suffered across his entire body. Training in pyrotechnics means that Lynns is skilled in the construction of incendiary devices, both handheld ?pipebomb? size and large-scale demolition level charges. Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot PENGUIN Initially affiliated with various street gangs and suspected of opportunistic fencing, Cobblepot is now believed to be the mastermind of an underground arms trade business. Additional alleged illegal businesses include a city-wide gambling ring, international arms smuggling, racketeering, and murder. Recent rumors also have him running an underground, unlicensed fighting ring. Several warrants exist for Cobblepot?s arrest, but he has never been served, due to a highly secretive off-the-grid lifestyle. Cobblepot?s name is not on the lease for any of his businesses, he owns no property, and pays no bills in his own name.Of note: The only transaction Cobblepot has been officially associated with was the purchase of the Final Offer, an aging Somaliland-registered freighter believed to operate in U.S. waters. Alberto Falcone ALBERTO FALCONE Black sheep of the well-known Falcone family; medical records indicate a history of mental instability. Extent of his involvement in the family?s alleged criminal activities is unknown. Psychological records curated by Blackgate psychologist Hugo Strange suggest Falcone suffers from dissociative identity disorder. Though not currently under active investigation, the department psychologist has issued mental health warnings: it?s only a matter of time before he snaps. ''', '275' , '19.99', '2',  'PS3');

padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 60px} Story Taking place before the rise of Gotham City''s most dangerous criminals, villains and assassins, players will meet many important characters for the first time.The game showcases a young, raw, unrefined Batman as he faces a defining moment in his early career as a crime fighter that sets his path to becoming the Dark Knight. As the story unfolds, witness identities being formed and key relationships being forged. From the Files of the Gotham City Police Department Anonymous Vigilante BATMAN Conflicting reports of the suspect range from a highly trained individual or group of individuals, to allegations of a ?large winged creature.? Sporadic sightings were first reported two years ago, though frequency of sightings is up 80% in last six months. Limited photographic and forensic evidence suggests a single individual ? a white male adult - utilizing a dark, militarized armor with unexplained high mobility.Various statements indicate the suspect is armed with hi-tech weaponry and tools, which may allow for rapid deployment and navigation between buildings. Unsubstantiated claims indicate the suspect employs unlicensed low-flying aircraft.Multiple outstanding warrants for ?The Batman? exist, including: assault with a deadly weapon against both criminals and law enforcement officers, breaking and entering, carrying a concealed weapon, interfering with a crime scene, and fleeing the scene of a crime. Considered armed and extremely dangerous. Multiple cases of resisting arrest have proven suspect both an expert hand-to-hand combatant and evasion specialist. Roman Sionis BLACK MASK Gotham City business owner Roman Sionis is alleged to be one of the city?s most powerful crime lords, though no convictions have ever been made. Sionis maintains several ?legitimate? businesses - many of which are believed to be fronts for illegal operations. Notable businesses in his portfolio include: Janus Cosmetics, Gotham Merchants? Bank, and the now-defunct Sionis Steel Works. Sionis has been charged with embezzling city funds, murder, racketeering, distribution of illegal narcotics, and other offenses, but never convicted. In previous trials, witnesses for the prosecution have been known to recant, die, or disappear. Investigation is ongoing. Slade Wilson DEATHSTROKE FBI files link Slade Wilson to the assassination of various offshore dictators and business people. Less is known about his domestic activities. Additional skills include: Weapons expert. Demolitions expert. Close quarters combat. Ambush techniques.Following his military service, Wilson worked for various private military contractors before striking out on his own ? and allegedly becoming one of the highest paid contract killers in the world, specializing in high profile assassinations.CONFIRMED METAHUMAN STATUS ? experimental speed and strength enhancements of unknown origin. Suspect should be assumed to be armed with multiple weapons, and considered expert with edged weapons, firearms and explosives. Distinguishing characteristics include an impaired right eye, graying hair, and orange accented black body armor. Name Unknown BANE The fugitive known as ?Bane? is currently on the run and wanted by the sovereign government of Santa Prisca following a prison break from Pena Duro penitentiary. While no records have been found to substantiate this, rumors allege Bane was born and raised within the prison walls. Bane is believed to be travelling with a large group of mercenaries who refer to themselves only as ?Followers?.Bane is rumored to have larger-than-normal size and extraordinary strength ? though this is believed to be as a result of his abuse of performance enhancing drugs. Witnesses report observing temporary changes in musculature and bone structure in certain circumstances, but without physical proof this is regarded as unreliable testimony.Individual is deemed extremely dangerous ? and as cunning as he is physically strong. While he is often armed, his extreme physical strength is considered a deadly weapon even when he is unarmed. Floyd Lawton DEADSHOT Prior to his dishonorable discharge, Lawton received ?Expert? level Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges in all AR670-1 weapon categories. Academy instructors remarked that he didn?t find directly hitting targets a challenge and has a tendency to insert his own additional requirements in order to ?make things interesting?.Little is known about Lawton since his discharge, though he is a suspect in connection with several murders and assassinations, all of which involved uniquely complex ballistic scenarios at long range.Federal and Interpol warrants have been issued but never served, and Federal warrants alternate between valid and rescinded. Lawton should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. Known for high-risk tactics to decrease his survivability and increase difficulty of any task at hand. It is highly likely that Lawton harbors a death wish ? consider this when engaging the suspect. COPPERHEAD COPPERHEAD ''''Copperhead'''' is a possible group identity or floating moniker.Initial reports of a contract killer using the name ''''Copperhead'''' have appeared in various South American Criminal Databases. Reports were, however, inconsistent: conflicting intelligence suggests ''''Copperhead'''' may be a pair or even a group of individuals, both male and female, operating under the pseudonym. Analysts suggest Guatemala is the center of operations of this identity.Consistent elements include snake-themed tattoo markings, and non-restrictive garment to aid with agility. At least two known suspects have been known to avoid wearing footwear.Some elements are consistent across all reports, and will be represented here. All reports indicate the killer is highly mobile, with an extremely flexible physiology. Case detectives suggest that the individual uses this ability to gain access to structures via small accessways, vents, and construction imperfections. Attributed killings are consistently either asphyxiation, fracture of the cervical vertebrae, or death through the application of exotic poisons. Name Unknown ANARKY Earlier reports flagged suspect as graffiti artist with an anti-authority/anarchist leanings. Suspected of organizing radical protests, occupying public spaces and erecting tent cities, and other public disturbances. Uses social media and hacktivism to harass political figures, business leaders, and peace officers. Targets individuals and organizations of financial success or prominence. Reports of recent radicalization from undercover officers. Acquisition of well-known precursors suggest attempts at manufacturing explosive devices. Anarky is wanted on charges of trespassing, destruction of public property, destruction of government property, and unregistered demonstrations. Has been added to domestic terrorist watch Name Unknown FIREFLY Unstable, erratic individual with advanced weaponry and demolition skills. Lynns is equipped with a military-grade flamethrower and custom light assembly acquired from an unascertained source. Has been alleged to steal chemical materials in bulk ? aviation fuels, various chemical primers, and restricted reagents that suggest a specific chemical requirement for both the flight fuels and his incinerator device.His source files denote extensive psychological issues. Top level summary is that Lynns displays a total disregard for his well being at a level that would be classified as irrational. Extreme disregard for his own safety ? this has caused or is symptomatic of the degree of burns he has suffered across his entire body. Training in pyrotechnics means that Lynns is skilled in the construction of incendiary devices, both handheld ?pipebomb? size and large-scale demolition level charges. Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot PENGUIN Initially affiliated with various street gangs and suspected of opportunistic fencing, Cobblepot is now believed to be the mastermind of an underground arms trade business. Additional alleged illegal businesses include a city-wide gambling ring, international arms smuggling, racketeering, and murder. Recent rumors also have him running an underground, unlicensed fighting ring. Several warrants exist for Cobblepot?s arrest, but he has never been served, due to a highly secretive off-the-grid lifestyle. Cobblepot?s name is not on the lease for any of his businesses, he owns no property, and pays no bills in his own name.Of note: The only transaction Cobblepot has been officially associated with was the purchase of the Final Offer, an aging Somaliland-registered freighter believed to operate in U.S. waters. Alberto Falcone ALBERTO FALCONE Black sheep of the well-known Falcone family; medical records indicate a history of mental instability. Extent of his involvement in the family?s alleged criminal activities is unknown. Psychological records curated by Blackgate psychologist Hugo Strange suggest Falcone suffers from dissociative identity disorder. Though not currently under active investigation, the department psychologist has issued mental health warnings: it?s only a matter of time before he snaps. ''', '275' , '19.99', '1',  'PS3');

They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it''s time to get the job done. Michael He''s a veteran bank robber, and an expert with the kind of knowledge that only comes from years as a successful career criminal. Now retired and living comfortably in an unofficial sort of witness protection, Michael''s not without his own problems though - he has a wife who can''t stop spending money and two spoiled kids he doesn''t understand at all. Michael made it out and got everything he wanted, and he''s still miserable. Franklin A former street gangster now looking for real opportunities and serious money, Franklin works as a repo man for an Armenian luxury car dealership that runs scams on ambitious young hotshots with new money, selling them expensive cars they can?t afford.

Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends... Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos'' weirdos, junkies, drunkies, or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected...

To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution.

For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money... Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends... Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos'' weirdos, junkies, drunkies, or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected... Heists Petty crimes, hustling and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks. Grand Theft Auto Online Grand Theft Auto Online is a dynamic and persistent online world for 16 players that begins by sharing gameplay features, geography and mechanics with Grand Theft Auto V, but will continue to expand and evolve after its launch with new content created by Rockstar Games and the Grand Theft Auto community. Grand Theft Auto Online takes the fundamental Grand Theft Auto concepts of freedom, ambient activity and mission-based gameplay and makes them available to multiple players in an incredibly detailed and responsive online world. In Grand Theft Auto Online, players have the freedom to explore alone or with friends, work cooperatively to complete missions, band together to participate in activities and ambient events, or compete in traditional game modes with the entire community, all with the personality and refined mechanics of Grand Theft Auto V. Players can invest in their character through customizing their appearance, improving their stats, owning customized vehicles, purchasing personal property, and taking part in missions, jobs and activities to earn reputation and cash to open up new opportunities to rise through the criminal ranks. The world of Grand Theft Auto Online will constantly grow and change as new content is added, creating the first ever persistent and dynamic Grand Theft Auto game world.', '282' , '29.99', '1',  'PS3');

Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest. Features: Bold New Beginning — His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive…And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew.  A Second Chance — Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. A Darker, More Elemental World — From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. Vicious, Physical Combat — With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre. A New Beginning — His vengeance against the gods of Olympus far behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the lands of Norse Gods and monsters.

Questioning the dark lineage he’s passed on to his son, he hopes to make amends for the shortcomings of his past.Midgard and Beyond — Set within the untamed forests, mountains, and realms of Norse lore, God of War features a distinctly new setting with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods.Vicious, Physical Combat  — With an intimate, over-the-shoulder free camera that brings the action closer than ever, combat in God of War is up close, frenetic, and unflinching.

The biggest step in gameplay innovation in franchise history, FIFA 18 introduces Real Player Motion Technology, an all-new animation system which unlocks a new level of responsiveness, and player personality – now Cristiano Ronaldo and other top players feel and move exactly like they do on the real pitch. Player Control combined with new Team Styles and Positioning give you the tools to deliver Dramatic Moments that ignite Immersive Atmospheres around the world. The World’s Game also takes you on a global journey as Alex Hunter Returns along with a star-studded cast of characters, including Cristiano Ronaldo and other European football stars. And in FIFA Ultimate Team™, FUT ICONS, featuring Ronaldo Nazário and other football legends, are coming to FIFA 18 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC when the game launches on September 29, 2017. GAMEPLAY AND PRESENTATION Powered by Frostbite Attention to innovation in true-to-life action, new football worlds and character depth, Frostbite helps to further blur the lines between the virtual and real worlds. Using movie studio-style advanced shadowing and occlusion techniques to benefit character rendering and overall pitch presentation, FIFA 18 delivers the most visually arresting and authentic football simulation ever. Player Control Real Player Motion Technology: The all-new, game-changing animation system utilizes pose trajectory matching on every frame to deliver the franchise’s most responsive and fluid gameplay ever. New motion capture techniques and frame by frame animation transitions ensure gameplay accurately represents the reality of football. Real Player Motion Tech is the catalyst for an increased fidelity in movement for every player on the pitch, immediately taking authenticity to another level.    Player Personality: Six new character archetypes and new player mapping technology differentiate players on the pitch to give them their own distinct identity. For the first time ever, real-world movements, size and attributes inform how a player moves, allowing you to feel the life-like tendencies of the world’s best. Ronaldo’s signature sprint, Sterling’s unique turns, and Robben’s distinct arm movement are all immediately recognizable in FIFA 18. Dribbling Overhaul: In FIFA 18, you will run at defenders with confidence knowing that the best players can change direction on a dime. New dribbling mechanics enable players to inject more creativity into 1v1 situations. Take more defined touches, make tighter turns, and explode into attack more dynamically than ever before. Responsive: Creative on-ball skills, contextual touches, and a re-imagining of the control dribble mechanic give players new options when building up attacks in tight spaces. Change direction with ease and feel your player respond when you escape a defender lunging to tackle. Explosive: Authentic and dynamic speed-based animations allow you to explode more rapidly from controlled touches into full tilt sprints. Team Styles and Positioning New Player Positioning: With more freedom in motion, your teammates examine the pitch and react accordingly; darting forward in coordinated runs, or moving into space to provide consistent attacking support. New player positioning gives you a well-balanced and spread pitch with more opportunities in time and space to read the play. Team Styles: A deep set of authentic playing styles attributed to several teams put the most-recognized tactics on the pitch in FIFA 18 - now in AI you will immediately recognize the tiki-taka of some of Europe’s best clubs or the high-pressing style of teams in the Premier League. Feel a change in defensive and attacking approaches every time you choose a new club or opponent. Dynamic Quick Substitutes: All-new context based substitution prompts allow players to easily make changes without pausing the match. Whether it''s a missed chance, or necessary response to conceding a goal, you can instantly decide if a change is needed without visiting the menu. Immersive Atmospheres Regional Atmospheres: Authentic sun positions, cinematic atmosphere grading, signature pitch-side fixtures, authentic broadcast overlays in La Liga and MLS, on-pitch debris, club and stadium specific banners, adaptive commentary, and changes in pitch quality all come together to bring the most immersive football experiences to life in FIFA 18. High-Def Dynamic Crowds: All-new individual crowd reactions and expanded regional chant support have you feeding off the energy of your supporters. Hear authentic chants build as you mount an attack, incite realistic excitement when you score and even interact with the crowd while celebrating. Dramatic Moments Wonder Goals: New locomotion and finishing animations unlock more fluid striking and heading, combining to increase the potential for more dramatic finishes. Player Personality ensures the heroes of the game stand tall in the biggest moments, finishing more often on the biggest stages.  New Crossing Control: All-new crossing controls provide the player with a variety of options to put the ball into the box, creating dynamic attacking chances. Whipped to the spot, arching, and back-stick crosses increase the variety of delivery to accurately pick out the attacking player. THE JOURNEY: HUNTER RETURNS The World’s Game takes you on a global journey as Alex Hunter returns along with a star-studded cast of characters and top football talent, like Ronaldo and other European stars. After a breathtaking first season in the Premier League, Hunter is gaining recognition from top clubs the world over and he is willing to explore any options coming his way.

It''s not an HD-remaster or up-rezzing of PS2-era textures. Yakuza Kiwami was recreated from the ground up exclusively for the PlayStation 4. That means every visual element was optimized for the 1080p/60fps environment, every line of the script was re-recorded by series actors and for the first time in the West, gamers will be able to hear the original Japanese language track.Then there''s the game itself!

Veterans will experience a familiar Kamurocho - the fictional red-light district of Tokyo the game is set in - and plot, but with new levels of story depth and graphical polish.BACK TO THE ROOTS OF THE YAKUZA SERIES: Kiwami adds nearly 30 minutes of cutscenes, providing all-new insight into the game’s plot. There’s also added distractions (Pocket Circuit car racing, MesuKing: Battle Bug Beauties, new hostesses, and more), side quests and combat updates to bring the original Yakuza game into the latest console generation.MAJIMA EVERYWHERE: Completely new to Kiwami is the “Majima Everywhere” system, where the series’ deranged, one-eyed maniac will constantly surprise and challenge Kiryu to combat when he least expects it. We’re talking “popping out of a goofy costume” levels of surprise, so players must stay on their toes and be ready to defend themselves from Kiryu’s chief rival.EXTREME REVITALIZATION: Kiwami is rebuilt from the ground up with all new HD assets, exclusive Japanese voice audio re-recorded by the series cast, and more; optimized for the PlayStation 4 and running in 1080p/60fps.

padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 60px} Story Taking place before the rise of Gotham City''s most dangerous criminals, villains and assassins, players will meet many important characters for the first time.The game showcases a young, raw, unrefined Batman as he faces a defining moment in his early career as a crime fighter that sets his path to becoming the Dark Knight. As the story unfolds, witness identities being formed and key relationships being forged. From the Files of the Gotham City Police Department Anonymous Vigilante BATMAN Conflicting reports of the suspect range from a highly trained individual or group of individuals, to allegations of a ?large winged creature.? Sporadic sightings were first reported two years ago, though frequency of sightings is up 80% in last six months. Limited photographic and forensic evidence suggests a single individual ? a white male adult - utilizing a dark, militarized armor with unexplained high mobility.Various statements indicate the suspect is armed with hi-tech weaponry and tools, which may allow for rapid deployment and navigation between buildings. Unsubstantiated claims indicate the suspect employs unlicensed low-flying aircraft.Multiple outstanding warrants for ?The Batman? exist, including: assault with a deadly weapon against both criminals and law enforcement officers, breaking and entering, carrying a concealed weapon, interfering with a crime scene, and fleeing the scene of a crime. Considered armed and extremely dangerous. Multiple cases of resisting arrest have proven suspect both an expert hand-to-hand combatant and evasion specialist. Roman Sionis BLACK MASK Gotham City business owner Roman Sionis is alleged to be one of the city?s most powerful crime lords, though no convictions have ever been made. Sionis maintains several ?legitimate? businesses - many of which are believed to be fronts for illegal operations. Notable businesses in his portfolio include: Janus Cosmetics, Gotham Merchants? Bank, and the now-defunct Sionis Steel Works. Sionis has been charged with embezzling city funds, murder, racketeering, distribution of illegal narcotics, and other offenses, but never convicted. In previous trials, witnesses for the prosecution have been known to recant, die, or disappear. Investigation is ongoing. Slade Wilson DEATHSTROKE FBI files link Slade Wilson to the assassination of various offshore dictators and business people. Less is known about his domestic activities. Additional skills include: Weapons expert. Demolitions expert. Close quarters combat. Ambush techniques.Following his military service, Wilson worked for various private military contractors before striking out on his own ? and allegedly becoming one of the highest paid contract killers in the world, specializing in high profile assassinations.CONFIRMED METAHUMAN STATUS ? experimental speed and strength enhancements of unknown origin. Suspect should be assumed to be armed with multiple weapons, and considered expert with edged weapons, firearms and explosives. Distinguishing characteristics include an impaired right eye, graying hair, and orange accented black body armor. Name Unknown BANE The fugitive known as ?Bane? is currently on the run and wanted by the sovereign government of Santa Prisca following a prison break from Pena Duro penitentiary. While no records have been found to substantiate this, rumors allege Bane was born and raised within the prison walls. Bane is believed to be travelling with a large group of mercenaries who refer to themselves only as ?Followers?.Bane is rumored to have larger-than-normal size and extraordinary strength ? though this is believed to be as a result of his abuse of performance enhancing drugs. Witnesses report observing temporary changes in musculature and bone structure in certain circumstances, but without physical proof this is regarded as unreliable testimony.Individual is deemed extremely dangerous ? and as cunning as he is physically strong. While he is often armed, his extreme physical strength is considered a deadly weapon even when he is unarmed. Floyd Lawton DEADSHOT Prior to his dishonorable discharge, Lawton received ?Expert? level Army Marksmanship Qualification Badges in all AR670-1 weapon categories. Academy instructors remarked that he didn?t find directly hitting targets a challenge and has a tendency to insert his own additional requirements in order to ?make things interesting?.Little is known about Lawton since his discharge, though he is a suspect in connection with several murders and assassinations, all of which involved uniquely complex ballistic scenarios at long range.Federal and Interpol warrants have been issued but never served, and Federal warrants alternate between valid and rescinded. Lawton should be considered armed and extremely dangerous. Known for high-risk tactics to decrease his survivability and increase difficulty of any task at hand. It is highly likely that Lawton harbors a death wish ? consider this when engaging the suspect. COPPERHEAD COPPERHEAD ''''Copperhead'''' is a possible group identity or floating moniker.Initial reports of a contract killer using the name ''''Copperhead'''' have appeared in various South American Criminal Databases. Reports were, however, inconsistent: conflicting intelligence suggests ''''Copperhead'''' may be a pair or even a group of individuals, both male and female, operating under the pseudonym. Analysts suggest Guatemala is the center of operations of this identity.Consistent elements include snake-themed tattoo markings, and non-restrictive garment to aid with agility. At least two known suspects have been known to avoid wearing footwear.Some elements are consistent across all reports, and will be represented here. All reports indicate the killer is highly mobile, with an extremely flexible physiology. Case detectives suggest that the individual uses this ability to gain access to structures via small accessways, vents, and construction imperfections. Attributed killings are consistently either asphyxiation, fracture of the cervical vertebrae, or death through the application of exotic poisons. Name Unknown ANARKY Earlier reports flagged suspect as graffiti artist with an anti-authority/anarchist leanings. Suspected of organizing radical protests, occupying public spaces and erecting tent cities, and other public disturbances. Uses social media and hacktivism to harass political figures, business leaders, and peace officers. Targets individuals and organizations of financial success or prominence. Reports of recent radicalization from undercover officers. Acquisition of well-known precursors suggest attempts at manufacturing explosive devices. Anarky is wanted on charges of trespassing, destruction of public property, destruction of government property, and unregistered demonstrations. Has been added to domestic terrorist watch Name Unknown FIREFLY Unstable, erratic individual with advanced weaponry and demolition skills. Lynns is equipped with a military-grade flamethrower and custom light assembly acquired from an unascertained source. Has been alleged to steal chemical materials in bulk ? aviation fuels, various chemical primers, and restricted reagents that suggest a specific chemical requirement for both the flight fuels and his incinerator device.His source files denote extensive psychological issues. Top level summary is that Lynns displays a total disregard for his well being at a level that would be classified as irrational. Extreme disregard for his own safety ? this has caused or is symptomatic of the degree of burns he has suffered across his entire body. Training in pyrotechnics means that Lynns is skilled in the construction of incendiary devices, both handheld ?pipebomb? size and large-scale demolition level charges. Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot PENGUIN Initially affiliated with various street gangs and suspected of opportunistic fencing, Cobblepot is now believed to be the mastermind of an underground arms trade business. Additional alleged illegal businesses include a city-wide gambling ring, international arms smuggling, racketeering, and murder. Recent rumors also have him running an underground, unlicensed fighting ring. Several warrants exist for Cobblepot?s arrest, but he has never been served, due to a highly secretive off-the-grid lifestyle. Cobblepot?s name is not on the lease for any of his businesses, he owns no property, and pays no bills in his own name.Of note: The only transaction Cobblepot has been officially associated with was the purchase of the Final Offer, an aging Somaliland-registered freighter believed to operate in U.S. waters. Alberto Falcone ALBERTO FALCONE Black sheep of the well-known Falcone family; medical records indicate a history of mental instability. Extent of his involvement in the family?s alleged criminal activities is unknown. Psychological records curated by Blackgate psychologist Hugo Strange suggest Falcone suffers from dissociative identity disorder. Though not currently under active investigation, the department psychologist has issued mental health warnings: it?s only a matter of time before he snaps. ''', '642' , '49.99', '1',  'Wii_U');

A group of 12 have had enough and initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist - a deadly countdown of escalating terrorist attacks on U.S. interests. Sam Fisher is the leader of the newly formed 4th Echelon unit: a clandestine unit that answers solely to the President of the United States. Sam and his team must hunt down these terrorists by any means necessary, and stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero. Splinter Cell Blacklist offers enhanced gameplay options on the WiiU. The Gamepad mimics Sam?s OpSat, allowing the player to operate gadgets such as tri-rotor drones, sticky cam and much more through touch and motion based inputs.Game Overview: The BlacklistThe United States has a military presence in two-thirds of countries around the world. Some of them have had enough. A group of terrorists calling themselves The Engineers initiate a terror ultimatum called the Blacklist ? a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on US interests at home and abroad.Operate Without RestrictionsSam is back in his ops suit and goggles, and he?s more lethal and agile than ever. Granted the freedom to do whatever it takes to stop the Blacklist, Sam flies from exotic locales to US cities as he races against the clock to find out who?s behind this devastating threat.- Character Bios -Sam FisherSam Fisher knows exactly what he was made to be: a multimillion-dollar weapon developed by the US government to do what few others can do. Long before Third Echelon tapped him to be the first Splinter Cell agent, Sam was operating behind enemy lines, in situations where traditional rules of engagement didn?t apply. From Panama and the Persian Gulf to Bolivia, Columbia, Yugoslavia, and Kosovo, Fisher carried out missions which most American citizens would be horrified to learn about, should the US Government ever admit they occurred. A former Navy SEAL, Sam belonged to an elite brotherhood of warriors ready to sacrifice their lives in defense of America?s freedoms. Combat, espionage, and constant training have defined his adult life. His tactical experience has become part of his instinct.Now, however, he stands alone, having rejected what his service had become and the mandates of those giving him orders. Having sacrificed everything for his country ? his marriage, his daughter, his reputation, and his best friend ? he finished his last assignment and walked away, a human weapon gone rogue. And the funny thing is, he almost didn?t become a soldier at all.Charlie ColeEqual parts brilliant and reckless (not on purpose ? he just doesn?t think), Charlie has been getting himself in and out of trouble as a hacker since he was twelve. Far from a solitary introvert, Charlie enjoys a healthy social life and has a natural self-deprecating charm that he uses to defuse tension or make light of those who take things (and themselves too seriously).Owing to his youth and focus on tech, Charlie hasn?t suffered many consequences in the real world so he?s pretty cavalier about the trouble he gets in. It?s hard to worry when you?ve been able to talk or tech your way out of any problem you?ve run into. It?s all just a game and Charlie always wins? well almost always. And when he doesn?t, well, Charlie will grow into a key member of the Fourth Echelon team but he?s got a lot to learn, including how to be calm under fire and how to keep focus when all breaks loose (especially when it just might be his fault).GrimAnna Grímsdóttir (known as ''''Grim'''' to her friends in the NSA) is the technical operations manager at Third Echelon. Her role is to provide Sam Fisher with technical support in the field, as well as to analyze and interpret much of the electronic data. A skilled hacker, Grímsdóttir normally tries to remotely hack into an objective computer system before Fisher is inserted, or when not possible does it direct from Fisher''s OPSAT connection to a computer terminal.VicVictor ''''Vic'''' Anthony Christopher Coste is one of Sam Fisher''s oldest friends. The two served together on SEAL Team Two in Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991. During their time in Iraq, Coste single-handedly rescued Sam from a hostage situation after he was captured by Iraqi forces during a disastrous mission. After leaving the Navy, Coste later became a private security consultant. He served as Sam''s contact in Tom Clancy?s Splinter Cell Conviction®, giving him vital information and equipment during certain missions. Near the end of the game, Coste reunited Sam with his daughter Sarah. In Conviction, Coste also served as the game''s narrator, retelling the story in a Black Arrow PMC interrogation room. The player also took control of Victor during a flashback to the mission where he saved Sam. Following Conviction, Vic and Sam are working together for Vic?s PMC, Paladin 9, taking contracts they believe in, as opposed to blindly following orders. That is, until the first Blacklist attack, where Vic is horrifically injured by a grenade when trying to protect Sam.- Gadgets -Tri-RotorA remote-pilotable flying drone that fires Sticky Shocker darts. Its rotors can be heard by hostiles if you fly too close.Use the Tri-Rotor to: Scout out areas and Mark hostiles, or attract enemies. Upgrade to gain the ability Self-Destruct and emit sonar pulsesSonar is unavailable in Perfectionist or near Drone Operators. Drone Operators cannot jam the Tri-Rotor?s main video frequency.Sticky Noise MakerUse it to create an opening to slip through patrols, or lure hostiles into a trap.

Long before Third Echelon tapped him to be the first Splinter Cell agent, Sam was operating behind enemy lines, in situations where traditional rules of engagement didn?t apply. From Panama and the Persian Gulf to Bolivia, Columbia, Yugoslavia, and Kosovo, Fisher carried out missions which most American citizens would be horrified to learn about, should the US Government ever admit they occurred. A former Navy SEAL, Sam belonged to an elite brotherhood of warriors ready to sacrifice their lives in defense of America?s freedoms. Combat, espionage, and constant training have defined his adult life. His tactical experience has become part of his instinct.Now, however, he stands alone, having rejected what his service had become and the mandates of those giving him orders. Having sacrificed everything for his country ? his marriage, his daughter, his reputation, and his best friend ? he finished his last assignment and walked away, a human weapon gone rogue. And the funny thing is, he almost didn?t become a soldier at all.Charlie ColeEqual parts brilliant and reckless (not on purpose ? he just doesn?t think), Charlie has been getting himself in and out of trouble as a hacker since he was twelve. Far from a solitary introvert, Charlie enjoys a healthy social life and has a natural self-deprecating charm that he uses to defuse tension or make light of those who take things (and themselves too seriously).Owing to his youth and focus on tech, Charlie hasn?t suffered many consequences in the real world so he?s pretty cavalier about the trouble he gets in. It?s hard to worry when you?ve been able to talk or tech your way out of any problem you?ve run into. It?s all just a game and Charlie always wins? well almost always. And when he doesn?t, well, Charlie will grow into a key member of the Fourth Echelon team but he?s got a lot to learn, including how to be calm under fire and how to keep focus when all breaks loose (especially when it just might be his fault).GrimAnna Grímsdóttir (known as ''''Grim'''' to her friends in the NSA) is the technical operations manager at Third Echelon. Her role is to provide Sam Fisher with technical support in the field, as well as to analyze and interpret much of the electronic data. A skilled hacker, Grímsdóttir normally tries to remotely hack into an objective computer system before Fisher is inserted, or when not possible does it direct from Fisher''s OPSAT connection to a computer terminal.VicVictor ''''Vic'''' Anthony Christopher Coste is one of Sam Fisher''s oldest friends. The two served together on SEAL Team Two in Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991. During their time in Iraq, Coste single-handedly rescued Sam from a hostage situation after he was captured by Iraqi forces during a disastrous mission. After leaving the Navy, Coste later became a private security consultant. He served as Sam''s contact in Tom Clancy?s Splinter Cell Conviction®, giving him vital information and equipment during certain missions. Near the end of the game, Coste reunited Sam with his daughter Sarah. In Conviction, Coste also served as the game''s narrator, retelling the story in a Black Arrow PMC interrogation room. The player also took control of Victor during a flashback to the mission where he saved Sam. Following Conviction, Vic and Sam are working together for Vic?s PMC, Paladin 9, taking contracts they believe in, as opposed to blindly following orders. That is, until the first Blacklist attack, where Vic is horrifically injured by a grenade when trying to protect Sam.- Gadgets -Tri-RotorA remote-pilotable flying drone that fires Sticky Shocker darts.

A former Navy SEAL, Sam belonged to an elite brotherhood of warriors ready to sacrifice their lives in defense of America?s freedoms. Combat, espionage, and constant training have defined his adult life. His tactical experience has become part of his instinct.Now, however, he stands alone, having rejected what his service had become and the mandates of those giving him orders. Having sacrificed everything for his country ? his marriage, his daughter, his reputation, and his best friend ? he finished his last assignment and walked away, a human weapon gone rogue. And the funny thing is, he almost didn?t become a soldier at all.Charlie ColeEqual parts brilliant and reckless (not on purpose ? he just doesn?t think), Charlie has been getting himself in and out of trouble as a hacker since he was twelve. Far from a solitary introvert, Charlie enjoys a healthy social life and has a natural self-deprecating charm that he uses to defuse tension or make light of those who take things (and themselves too seriously).Owing to his youth and focus on tech, Charlie hasn?t suffered many consequences in the real world so he?s pretty cavalier about the trouble he gets in. It?s hard to worry when you?ve been able to talk or tech your way out of any problem you?ve run into. It?s all just a game and Charlie always wins? well almost always. And when he doesn?t, well, Charlie will grow into a key member of the Fourth Echelon team but he?s got a lot to learn, including how to be calm under fire and how to keep focus when all breaks loose (especially when it just might be his fault).GrimAnna Grímsdóttir (known as ''''Grim'''' to her friends in the NSA) is the technical operations manager at Third Echelon. Her role is to provide Sam Fisher with technical support in the field, as well as to analyze and interpret much of the electronic data. A skilled hacker, Grímsdóttir normally tries to remotely hack into an objective computer system before Fisher is inserted, or when not possible does it direct from Fisher''s OPSAT connection to a computer terminal.VicVictor ''''Vic'''' Anthony Christopher Coste is one of Sam Fisher''s oldest friends. The two served together on SEAL Team Two in Iraq during the Gulf War in 1991. During their time in Iraq, Coste single-handedly rescued Sam from a hostage situation after he was captured by Iraqi forces during a disastrous mission. After leaving the Navy, Coste later became a private security consultant. He served as Sam''s contact in Tom Clancy?s Splinter Cell Conviction®, giving him vital information and equipment during certain missions. Near the end of the game, Coste reunited Sam with his daughter Sarah. In Conviction, Coste also served as the game''s narrator, retelling the story in a Black Arrow PMC interrogation room. The player also took control of Victor during a flashback to the mission where he saved Sam. Following Conviction, Vic and Sam are working together for Vic?s PMC, Paladin 9, taking contracts they believe in, as opposed to blindly following orders. That is, until the first Blacklist attack, where Vic is horrifically injured by a grenade when trying to protect Sam.- Gadgets -Tri-RotorA remote-pilotable flying drone that fires Sticky Shocker darts.

The biggest step in gameplay innovation in franchise history, FIFA 18 introduces Real Player Motion Technology, an all-new animation system which unlocks a new level of responsiveness, and player personality – now Cristiano Ronaldo and other top players feel and move exactly like they do on the real pitch. Player Control combined with new Team Styles and Positioning give you the tools to deliver Dramatic Moments that ignite Immersive Atmospheres around the world. The World’s Game also takes you on a global journey as Alex Hunter Returns along with a star-studded cast of characters, including Cristiano Ronaldo and other European football stars. And in FIFA Ultimate Team™, FUT ICONS, featuring Ronaldo Nazário and other football legends, are coming to FIFA 18 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC when the game launches on September 29, 2017. GAMEPLAY AND PRESENTATION Powered by Frostbite Attention to innovation in true-to-life action, new football worlds and character depth, Frostbite helps to further blur the lines between the virtual and real worlds. Using movie studio-style advanced shadowing and occlusion techniques to benefit character rendering and overall pitch presentation, FIFA 18 delivers the most visually arresting and authentic football simulation ever. Player Control Real Player Motion Technology: The all-new, game-changing animation system utilizes pose trajectory matching on every frame to deliver the franchise’s most responsive and fluid gameplay ever. New motion capture techniques and frame by frame animation transitions ensure gameplay accurately represents the reality of football. Real Player Motion Tech is the catalyst for an increased fidelity in movement for every player on the pitch, immediately taking authenticity to another level.    Player Personality: Six new character archetypes and new player mapping technology differentiate players on the pitch to give them their own distinct identity. For the first time ever, real-world movements, size and attributes inform how a player moves, allowing you to feel the life-like tendencies of the world’s best. Ronaldo’s signature sprint, Sterling’s unique turns, and Robben’s distinct arm movement are all immediately recognizable in FIFA 18. Dribbling Overhaul: In FIFA 18, you will run at defenders with confidence knowing that the best players can change direction on a dime. New dribbling mechanics enable players to inject more creativity into 1v1 situations. Take more defined touches, make tighter turns, and explode into attack more dynamically than ever before. Responsive: Creative on-ball skills, contextual touches, and a re-imagining of the control dribble mechanic give players new options when building up attacks in tight spaces. Change direction with ease and feel your player respond when you escape a defender lunging to tackle. Explosive: Authentic and dynamic speed-based animations allow you to explode more rapidly from controlled touches into full tilt sprints. Team Styles and Positioning New Player Positioning: With more freedom in motion, your teammates examine the pitch and react accordingly; darting forward in coordinated runs, or moving into space to provide consistent attacking support. New player positioning gives you a well-balanced and spread pitch with more opportunities in time and space to read the play. Team Styles: A deep set of authentic playing styles attributed to several teams put the most-recognized tactics on the pitch in FIFA 18 - now in AI you will immediately recognize the tiki-taka of some of Europe’s best clubs or the high-pressing style of teams in the Premier League. Feel a change in defensive and attacking approaches every time you choose a new club or opponent. Dynamic Quick Substitutes: All-new context based substitution prompts allow players to easily make changes without pausing the match. Whether it''s a missed chance, or necessary response to conceding a goal, you can instantly decide if a change is needed without visiting the menu. Immersive Atmospheres Regional Atmospheres: Authentic sun positions, cinematic atmosphere grading, signature pitch-side fixtures, authentic broadcast overlays in La Liga and MLS, on-pitch debris, club and stadium specific banners, adaptive commentary, and changes in pitch quality all come together to bring the most immersive football experiences to life in FIFA 18. High-Def Dynamic Crowds: All-new individual crowd reactions and expanded regional chant support have you feeding off the energy of your supporters. Hear authentic chants build as you mount an attack, incite realistic excitement when you score and even interact with the crowd while celebrating. Dramatic Moments Wonder Goals: New locomotion and finishing animations unlock more fluid striking and heading, combining to increase the potential for more dramatic finishes. Player Personality ensures the heroes of the game stand tall in the biggest moments, finishing more often on the biggest stages.  New Crossing Control: All-new crossing controls provide the player with a variety of options to put the ball into the box, creating dynamic attacking chances. Whipped to the spot, arching, and back-stick crosses increase the variety of delivery to accurately pick out the attacking player. THE JOURNEY: HUNTER RETURNS The World’s Game takes you on a global journey as Alex Hunter returns along with a star-studded cast of characters and top football talent, like Ronaldo and other European stars. After a breathtaking first season in the Premier League, Hunter is gaining recognition from top clubs the world over and he is willing to explore any options coming his way. He feels ready to take the next step, his future is bright, and the world is talking about Hunter….but life in football isn’t always fair.  Tour the Football World: From a summer break in Brazil, to a pre-season tour in Los Angeles, Alex Hunter experiences diverse football landscapes in a truly global journey. More to Play For: Chapter-based, short term objectives give Alex Hunter more to play for as he navigates his way through the second season of a prospering career.  A Star-Studded Cast: Cristiano Ronaldo leads a list of footballing greats and new, diverse characters in a star-studded cast well-suited to a blockbuster sequel. Impactful Decisions: Players will be faced with bigger and more difficult choices that will alter the story with long-term consequences.  Shape The Journey narrative in a personal way by making decisions that dictate Alex Hunter''s career and effect relationships with characters both on and off the pitch. Your Alex Hunter: Personalize the look of Alex Hunter by selecting his hair, tattoos, and clothing from a series of options.

Onslaught delivers four classically designed Call of Duty® multiplayer maps, each with their own distinct environments, size, and unique gameplay variety. Onslaught also arms players with a deadly new addition to their arsenal with the Maverick, a dual-purpose Assault Rifle/Sniper Rifle. Players can choose to use the Maverick as either an Assault Rifle or Sniper Rifle, depending on their tactical needs. Anchoring this first content pack is Episode 1: Nightfall, the first installment in Extinction?s four-part episodic narrative. At a remote facility in the Alaskan wilderness, the shadowy Nightfall Program has been researching the origins of the ?Alien? threat. A small team of elite soldiers must retrieve the intel and exterminate hordes of savage creatures. Episode 1: Nightfall features two all-new species of aliens and an exclusive weapon. Call of Duty ®: Ghosts Onslaught is available January 28th first, exclusively on Xbox Live, with other platforms to follow. Call of Duty®: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty® franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise''s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Single Player Campaign Ten years after a devastating mass event, America?s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what''s left of the nation''s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as ''Ghosts'' leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty® before. Multiplayer In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don''t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty® game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles. Squads Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he''ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun. ''', '745' , '9.99', '3',  'Xbox_360');

Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life. The biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created, Grand Theft Auto V blends storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and out of the lives of the game?s three lead characters, playing all sides of the game?s interwoven story. All the classic hallmarks of the groundbreaking series return, including incredible attention to detail and Grand Theft Auto?s darkly humorous take on modern culture, alongside a brand new and ambitious approach to open world multiplayer. Characters Introduction Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it''s time to get the job done. Michael He''s a veteran bank robber, and an expert with the kind of knowledge that only comes from years as a successful career criminal. Now retired and living comfortably in an unofficial sort of witness protection, Michael''s not without his own problems though - he has a wife who can''t stop spending money and two spoiled kids he doesn''t understand at all. Michael made it out and got everything he wanted, and he''s still miserable. Franklin A former street gangster now looking for real opportunities and serious money, Franklin works as a repo man for an Armenian luxury car dealership that runs scams on ambitious young hotshots with new money, selling them expensive cars they can?t afford. When they can?t make their payments but want to keep their cars, it?s Franklin?s job to get them back. Trevor Not interested in living by anyone else?s rules, Trevor''s a habitual drug user and extremely volatile individual that''s prone to destructive outbursts and violent rampages. A former criminal colleague of Michael''s from long ago - the less that''s said about him the better. Features Los Santos & Blaine County Our largest open world yet - by far - and spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas, the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, meth heads, party people, violent gangs, hikers, bikers and every other manner of colorful denizen. You''ll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor. ''Recreational'' Activity The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside... For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money... Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends... Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos'' weirdos, junkies, drunkies, or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected... Heists Petty crimes, hustling and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks. Grand Theft Auto Online Grand Theft Auto Online is a dynamic and persistent online world for 16 players that begins by sharing gameplay features, geography and mechanics with Grand Theft Auto V, but will continue to expand and evolve after its launch with new content created by Rockstar Games and the Grand Theft Auto community. Grand Theft Auto Online takes the fundamental Grand Theft Auto concepts of freedom, ambient activity and mission-based gameplay and makes them available to multiple players in an incredibly detailed and responsive online world. In Grand Theft Auto Online, players have the freedom to explore alone or with friends, work cooperatively to complete missions, band together to participate in activities and ambient events, or compete in traditional game modes with the entire community, all with the personality and refined mechanics of Grand Theft Auto V. Players can invest in their character through customizing their appearance, improving their stats, owning customized vehicles, purchasing personal property, and taking part in missions, jobs and activities to earn reputation and cash to open up new opportunities to rise through the criminal ranks. The world of Grand Theft Auto Online will constantly grow and change as new content is added, creating the first ever persistent and dynamic Grand Theft Auto game world.', '760' , '34.99', '2',  'Xbox_360');

The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.de Blob is a 3D platformer where players maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob''s goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies.Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the ''Color Revolutionaries'' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black''s I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets.de Blob: Flip, bounce and smash your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T.

Player Control combined with new Team Styles and Positioning give you the tools to deliver Dramatic Moments that ignite Immersive Atmospheres around the world. The World’s Game also takes you on a global journey as Alex Hunter Returns along with a star-studded cast of characters, including Cristiano Ronaldo and other European football stars. And in FIFA Ultimate Team™, FUT ICONS, featuring Ronaldo Nazário and other football legends, are coming to FIFA 18 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC when the game launches on September 29, 2017. GAMEPLAY AND PRESENTATION Powered by Frostbite Attention to innovation in true-to-life action, new football worlds and character depth, Frostbite helps to further blur the lines between the virtual and real worlds. Using movie studio-style advanced shadowing and occlusion techniques to benefit character rendering and overall pitch presentation, FIFA 18 delivers the most visually arresting and authentic football simulation ever. Player Control Real Player Motion Technology: The all-new, game-changing animation system utilizes pose trajectory matching on every frame to deliver the franchise’s most responsive and fluid gameplay ever. New motion capture techniques and frame by frame animation transitions ensure gameplay accurately represents the reality of football. Real Player Motion Tech is the catalyst for an increased fidelity in movement for every player on the pitch, immediately taking authenticity to another level.    Player Personality: Six new character archetypes and new player mapping technology differentiate players on the pitch to give them their own distinct identity. For the first time ever, real-world movements, size and attributes inform how a player moves, allowing you to feel the life-like tendencies of the world’s best. Ronaldo’s signature sprint, Sterling’s unique turns, and Robben’s distinct arm movement are all immediately recognizable in FIFA 18. Dribbling Overhaul: In FIFA 18, you will run at defenders with confidence knowing that the best players can change direction on a dime. New dribbling mechanics enable players to inject more creativity into 1v1 situations. Take more defined touches, make tighter turns, and explode into attack more dynamically than ever before. Responsive: Creative on-ball skills, contextual touches, and a re-imagining of the control dribble mechanic give players new options when building up attacks in tight spaces. Change direction with ease and feel your player respond when you escape a defender lunging to tackle. Explosive: Authentic and dynamic speed-based animations allow you to explode more rapidly from controlled touches into full tilt sprints. Team Styles and Positioning New Player Positioning: With more freedom in motion, your teammates examine the pitch and react accordingly; darting forward in coordinated runs, or moving into space to provide consistent attacking support. New player positioning gives you a well-balanced and spread pitch with more opportunities in time and space to read the play. Team Styles: A deep set of authentic playing styles attributed to several teams put the most-recognized tactics on the pitch in FIFA 18 - now in AI you will immediately recognize the tiki-taka of some of Europe’s best clubs or the high-pressing style of teams in the Premier League. Feel a change in defensive and attacking approaches every time you choose a new club or opponent. Dynamic Quick Substitutes: All-new context based substitution prompts allow players to easily make changes without pausing the match. Whether it''s a missed chance, or necessary response to conceding a goal, you can instantly decide if a change is needed without visiting the menu. Immersive Atmospheres Regional Atmospheres: Authentic sun positions, cinematic atmosphere grading, signature pitch-side fixtures, authentic broadcast overlays in La Liga and MLS, on-pitch debris, club and stadium specific banners, adaptive commentary, and changes in pitch quality all come together to bring the most immersive football experiences to life in FIFA 18. High-Def Dynamic Crowds: All-new individual crowd reactions and expanded regional chant support have you feeding off the energy of your supporters. Hear authentic chants build as you mount an attack, incite realistic excitement when you score and even interact with the crowd while celebrating. Dramatic Moments Wonder Goals: New locomotion and finishing animations unlock more fluid striking and heading, combining to increase the potential for more dramatic finishes. Player Personality ensures the heroes of the game stand tall in the biggest moments, finishing more often on the biggest stages.  New Crossing Control: All-new crossing controls provide the player with a variety of options to put the ball into the box, creating dynamic attacking chances. Whipped to the spot, arching, and back-stick crosses increase the variety of delivery to accurately pick out the attacking player. THE JOURNEY: HUNTER RETURNS The World’s Game takes you on a global journey as Alex Hunter returns along with a star-studded cast of characters and top football talent, like Ronaldo and other European stars.
